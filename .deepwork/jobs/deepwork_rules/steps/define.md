# Define Rule

## Objective

Create a new rule file in the `.deepwork/rules/` directory to enforce team guidelines, documentation requirements, or other constraints when specific files change.

## Task

Guide the user through defining a new rule by asking structured questions. **Do not create the rule without first understanding what they want to enforce.**

**Important**: Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask structured questions when gathering information from the user. This provides a better user experience with clear options and guided choices.

### Step 1: Understand the Rule Purpose

Start by asking structured questions to understand what the user wants to enforce:

1. **What guideline or constraint should this rule enforce?**
   - What situation triggers the need for action?
   - What files or directories, when changed, should trigger this rule?
   - Examples: "When config files change", "When API code changes", "When database schema changes"

2. **What action should be taken?**
   - What should the agent do when the rule triggers?
   - Update documentation? Perform a security review? Update tests?
   - Is there a specific file or process that needs attention?

3. **Are there any "safety" conditions?**
   - Are there files that, if also changed, mean the rule doesn't need to fire?
   - For example: If config changes AND install_guide.md changes, assume docs are already updated
   - This prevents redundant prompts when the user has already done the right thing

### Step 2: Choose the Detection Mode

Help the user select the appropriate detection mode:

**Trigger/Safety Mode** (most common):
- Fires when trigger patterns match AND no safety patterns match
- Use for: "When X changes, check Y" rules
- Example: When config changes, verify install docs

**Set Mode** (bidirectional correspondence):
- Fires when files that should change together don't all change
- Use for: Source/test pairing, model/migration sync
- Example: `src/foo.py` and `tests/foo_test.py` should change together

**Pair Mode** (directional correspondence):
- Fires when a trigger file changes but expected files don't
- Changes to expected files alone do NOT trigger
- Use for: API code requires documentation updates (but docs can update independently)

### Step 3: Define the Patterns

Help the user define glob patterns for files.

**Common patterns:**
- `src/**/*.py` - All Python files in src directory (recursive)
- `app/config/**/*` - All files in app/config directory
- `*.md` - All markdown files in root
- `src/api/**/*` - All files in the API directory
- `migrations/**/*.sql` - All SQL migrations

**Variable patterns (for set/pair modes):**
- `src/{path}.py` - Captures path variable (e.g., `foo/bar` from `src/foo/bar.py`)
- `tests/{path}_test.py` - Uses same path variable in corresponding file
- `{name}` matches single segment, `{path}` matches multiple segments

**Pattern syntax:**
- `*` - Matches any characters within a single path segment
- `**` - Matches any characters across multiple path segments (recursive)
- `?` - Matches a single character

### Step 4: Choose the Comparison Mode (Optional)

The `compare_to` field controls what baseline is used when detecting "changed files":

**Options:**
- `base` (default) - Compares to the base of the current branch (merge-base with main/master). Best for feature branches.
- `default_tip` - Compares to the current tip of the default branch. Useful for seeing difference from production.
- `prompt` - Compares to the state at the start of each prompt. For rules about very recent changes.

Most rules should use the default (`base`) and don't need to specify `compare_to`.

### Step 5: Write the Instructions

Create clear, actionable instructions for what the agent should do when the rule fires.

**Good instructions include:**
- What to check or review
- What files might need updating
- Specific actions to take
- Quality criteria for completion

**Template variables available in instructions:**
- `{trigger_files}` - Files that triggered the rule
- `{expected_files}` - Expected corresponding files (for set/pair modes)

### Step 6: Create the Rule File

Create a new file in `.deepwork/rules/` with a kebab-case filename:

**File Location**: `.deepwork/rules/{rule-name}.md`

**Format for Trigger/Safety Mode:**
```markdown
---
name: Friendly Name for the Rule
trigger: "glob/pattern/**/*"  # or array: ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
safety: "optional/pattern"    # optional, or array
compare_to: base              # optional: "base" (default), "default_tip", or "prompt"
---
Instructions for the agent when this rule fires.

Multi-line markdown content is supported.
```

**Format for Set Mode (bidirectional):**
```markdown
---
name: Source/Test Pairing
set:
  - src/{path}.py
  - tests/{path}_test.py
---
Source and test files should change together.

Modified: {trigger_files}
Expected: {expected_files}
```

**Format for Pair Mode (directional):**
```markdown
---
name: API Documentation
pair:
  trigger: api/{path}.py
  expects: docs/api/{path}.md
---
API code requires documentation updates.

Changed API: {trigger_files}
Update docs: {expected_files}
```

### Step 7: Verify the Rule

After creating the rule:

1. **Check the YAML frontmatter** - Ensure valid YAML formatting
2. **Test trigger patterns** - Verify patterns match intended files
3. **Review instructions** - Ensure they're clear and actionable
4. **Check for conflicts** - Ensure the rule doesn't conflict with existing ones

## Example Rules

### Update Documentation on Config Changes
`.deepwork/rules/config-docs.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Update Install Guide on Config Changes
trigger: app/config/**/*
safety: docs/install_guide.md
---
Configuration files have been modified. Please review docs/install_guide.md
and update it if any installation instructions need to change based on the
new configuration.
```

### Security Review for Auth Code
`.deepwork/rules/security-review.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Security Review for Authentication Changes
trigger:
  - src/auth/**/*
  - src/security/**/*
safety:
  - SECURITY.md
  - docs/security_audit.md
---
Authentication or security code has been changed. Please:

1. Review for hardcoded credentials or secrets
2. Check input validation on user inputs
3. Verify access control logic is correct
4. Update security documentation if needed
```

### Source/Test Pairing
`.deepwork/rules/source-test-pairing.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Source/Test Pairing
set:
  - src/{path}.py
  - tests/{path}_test.py
---
Source and test files should change together.

When modifying source code, ensure corresponding tests are updated.
When adding tests, ensure they test actual source code.

Modified: {trigger_files}
Expected: {expected_files}
```

### API Documentation Sync
`.deepwork/rules/api-docs.md`:
```markdown
---
name: API Documentation Update
pair:
  trigger: src/api/{path}.py
  expects: docs/api/{path}.md
---
API code has changed. Please verify that API documentation in docs/api/
is up to date with the code changes. Pay special attention to:

- New or changed endpoints
- Modified request/response schemas
- Updated authentication requirements

Changed API: {trigger_files}
Update: {expected_files}
```

## Output Format

### .deepwork/rules/{rule-name}.md
Create a new file with the rule definition using YAML frontmatter and markdown body.

## Quality Criteria

- Asked structured questions to understand user requirements
- Rule name is clear and descriptive (used in promise tags)
- Correct detection mode selected for the use case
- Patterns accurately match the intended files
- Safety patterns prevent unnecessary triggering (if applicable)
- Instructions are actionable and specific
- YAML frontmatter is valid

## Context

Rules are evaluated automatically when the agent finishes a task. The system:
1. Determines which files have changed based on each rule's `compare_to` setting
2. Evaluates rules based on their detection mode (trigger/safety, set, or pair)
3. Skips rules where the correspondence is satisfied (for set/pair) or safety matched
4. Prompts you with instructions for any triggered rules

You can mark a rule as addressed by including `<promise>Rule Name</promise>` in your response (replace Rule Name with the actual rule name from the `name` field). This tells the system you've already handled that rule's requirements.
